            <h2>Super Monkey Ball 2 - Community Level Pack 1.0 (2017-01-22)</h2>
            <span>Back when custom Super Monkey Ball levels were just getting started, there were lots of people making levels. And, there were lots of people excited to play them. However, because Monkey Ball mods were <strong>so new</strong>, there was not enough time for anyone to have made an entire custom game yet. Yes, you could download 5 different ISOs, and play the few levels in each, but this made for a <strong>bad user experience</strong>. Most people were, understandably, too lazy to do this.</span>
            <span>Taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/" target="_blank">CTGP Revolution</a>, a Mario Kart Wii compliation hack of custom tracks from hundreds of creators, I decided to work on an equivalent version for Super Monkey Ball 2. I started working on this project as early as October 2016, and continued updating it as more levels came out. After a few months, enough <em>not absolutely terrible</em> levels had been created to make a full hack (every level replaced). And on <strong>January 22nd, 2017</strong>, I released the first version of the hack.</span>
            <span>Overall, the reception of this project was <strong>generally positive</strong> among both creators and players. I made sure to get permission from all custom level creators at the time, so they generally viewed it as a cool way to showcase their levels. This was the first custom Monkey Ball hack to have an active IL scene, indicating players enjoyed it. Although this pack has aged pretty poorly overtime, it's neat to see how far custom levels have come since the early days.</span>

          <h2>Super Monkey Ball 2 - Community Level Pack 1.5 (2017-07-09)</h2>
          <span>Even after just a couple months, as more custom levels released, Community Level Pack 1.0 was already beginning to show it's age. But, not enough time had yet passed for anyone to have completed an entire custom game. Thus, it felt right to begin work on an update to the hack, as it was still an important resource. However, this update ended up being <strong>more ambitious than anticipated:</strong></span>
          <ol>
            <li>The community discovered the ability to remove duplicate slots, enabling all 240 level slots to be replaced, meaning <strong>22</strong> additional levels could be included.</li>
            <li>The ability to have custom music was discovered, so it was decided the next update would have custom music <strong>for every world type</strong>. I allowed the community to select all the tracks, and I converted them to a Monkey Ball friendly format. <strong>This process took longer than expected.</strong></li>
            <li>It was decided that all levels (with the exception of animated levels, which were unable to have skyboxes at the time), should have a skybox, so skyboxes had to be <strong>manually added</strong> to every level without one (the majority of levels at the time). Back then, skyboxes could only be added directly to levels, rather than indirectly through world themes. This process ate up <strong>a lot of time.</strong></li>
            <li>White goals, the default goal on some levels, had to be replaced with appropriate colored goals (blue, green, or red). Another thing that ate <strong>a lot of time.</strong></li>
          </ol>
