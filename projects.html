            <h2>Super Monkey Ball 2 - Community Level Pack 1.0 (2017-01-22)</h2>
            <span>Back when custom Super Monkey Ball levels were just getting started, there were lots of people making levels. And, there were lots of people excited to play them. However, because Monkey Ball mods were so new, there was not enough time for anyone to have made an entire custom game yet. Yes, you could download 5 different ISOs, and play the few levels in each, but this made for a bad user experience. Most people were, understandably, too lazy to do this.</span>
            <span>Taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/" target="_blank">CTGP Revolution</a>, a Mario Kart Wii compliation hack of custom tracks from hundreds of creators, I decided to work on an equivalent version for Super Monkey Ball 2. I started working on this project as early as October 2016, and continued updating it as more levels came out. After a few months, enough <em>not absolutely terrible</em> levels had been created to make a full hack (every level replaced). And on January 22nd, 2017, I released the first version of the hack.</span>
            <span>Overall, the reception of this project was generally positive among both creators and players. I made sure to get permission from all custom level creators at the time, so they generally viewed it as a cool way to showcase their levels. This was the first custom Monkey Ball hack to have an active IL scene, indicating players enjoyed it.</span>
