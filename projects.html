            <span>Back when custom Super Monkey Ball levels were just getting started, there were lots of people making levels. And, there were lots of people excited to play them. However, because Monkey Ball mods were <strong>so new</strong>, there was not enough time for anyone to have made an entire custom game yet. Yes, you could download 5 different ISOs, and play the few levels in each, but this made for a <strong>bad user experience</strong>. Most people were, understandably, too lazy to do this.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/" target="_blank">CTGP Revolution</a>, a Mario Kart Wii compliation hack of custom tracks from hundreds of creators, I decided to work on an equivalent version for Super Monkey Ball 2. I started working on this project as early as October 2016, and continued updating it as more levels came out. After a few months, enough <em>not absolutely terrible</em> levels had been created to make a full hack (every level replaced). And on <strong>January 22nd, 2017</strong>, I released the first version of the hack.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Overall, the reception of this project was <strong>generally positive</strong> among both creators and players. I made sure to get permission from all custom level creators at the time, so they generally viewed it as <strong>a cool way to showcase their levels</strong>. This was the first custom Monkey Ball hack to have an active IL scene, indicating players enjoyed it. For a while, <strong>I</strong> was one of the most active players! Although this pack has aged pretty poorly overtime, it's neat to see how far custom levels have come since the early days.</span>

          <span>Even after just a couple months, as more custom levels released, Community Level Pack 1.0 was already beginning to show it's age. But, not enough time had yet passed for anyone to have completed an entire custom game. Thus, it felt right to begin work on an update to the hack, as it was still an important resource. However, this update ended up being <strong>more ambitious than anticipated:</strong></span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>The community discovered the ability to remove duplicate slots, enabling all 240 level slots to be replaced, meaning <strong>22</strong> additional levels could be included.</li>
            <li>The ability to have custom music was discovered, so it was decided the next update would have custom music <strong>for every world type</strong>. I allowed the community to select all the tracks, and I converted them to a Monkey Ball friendly format. <strong>This process took longer than expected.</strong></li>
            <li>It was decided that all levels (with the exception of animated levels, which were unable to have skyboxes at the time), should have a skybox, so skyboxes had to be <strong>manually added</strong> to every level without one (the majority of levels at the time). Back then, skyboxes could only be added directly to levels, rather than indirectly through world themes. This process ate up <strong>a lot of time.</strong></li>
            <li>White goals, the default goal on some levels, had to be replaced with appropriate colored goals (blue, green, or red). Another thing that ate <strong>a lot of time.</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <span>With all this in mind, I got help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlexSpeedruns" target="_blank">Alex</a>, a fellow Super Monkey Ball player, to help co-create this version. Even with the additional help, this pack took longer than expected to put together. We shot for the 1-year anniversery of custom levels, and just barely made it.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Despite putting in far more effort, the reception of this update was <strong>mostly positive, but mixed.</strong> Most creators, as well as the casual audience, enjoyed the update. However, among the more 'competitive' players, it was not recieved quite as well, and did not share the same level of IL activity as version 1.0. Some were even under the impression that the hack was <strong>rushed</strong>, which I still disagree with to this day. I believe there are a few reasons as to why:</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom level fatigue</strong> was beginning to set in for those active in the community. A lot of the early custom levels, while novel, definitely had major flaws, and because novelty was starting to wear off, I think those issues became more apparent.</li>
            <li>The <strong>difficulty balancing</strong> was criticized for being <strong>all over the place.</strong> Looking back, more time should have been dedicated to making this better. In fairness, however, difficulty balancing is <strong>notoriously difficult</strong> for Super Monkey Ball.</li>
            <li>The set of levels we chose to replace could have been better. One of the main critiques is that <strong>ugly, but somewhat fun levels</strong>, were often replaced by <strong>good-looking, boring levels</strong>. In my personal opinion, this is the strongest critique, and was definitely a mistake.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <span>With all that being said, I am still relatively happy with how it turned out. By the time this update came out, custom level creators were starting to release custom games, so I decided that, going forward, their was <strong>no longer a need for Community Level Packs</strong>. <em>I have no affiliation with any community level packs after this release. I do find it cool that further updates were inspiried by the originals!</em></span>

          <h2>Super Monkey Ball Live IL Sheet (2022-04-07)</h2>
          <figure class="fr">
            <img class="article-img" src="img/live-sheet.png" alt="Screenshot of a relatively barren sheet">
            <figcaption>Screenshot of a relatively barren sheet</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <span>The <strong>Super Monkey Ball Live IL Spreadsheet</strong> was a Google Sheets page in which users could submit their best score & time ILs, with the rule that <strong>submissions must have a live recording.</strong> By using protected ranges, the sheet was designed such that <strong>users were only able to edit cells that 'belong to them'</strong>, which is any row with their name in the left-most cell. The only exception to this condition were <strong>moderators</strong>, who had write access to every cells on the sheet.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>For each sheet, which corresonded to a game and IL type, each player had a <strong>point value</strong> and <strong>medals count</strong> (gold, silver, & bronze) assigned to them. As users submit more PBs, the number of points they recieved increased (more points were awarded to better submissions), and they could climb the ranks, as the <strong>ordering of players</strong> was determined by the <strong>nubmer of points</strong>. <strong>Gold, silver, & bronze medals</strong> were awarded to <strong>first, second, & third place</strong> score/time submissions respectively.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Emperically, this project was a failure. This is evidenced by the fact that pratically no one used the sheet, <em>not even myself!</em> There are many good reasons this project never took off:</span>
          <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Bad UI:</strong> By far, the weakest aspect of using Google Sheets as a leaderboard is that it makes for a poor user interface. The information density per page is far too high, and it takes too long to learn for most people.</li>
            <li><strong>Bugs were common:</strong> The primary reason for this is because I <strong>did not design this project from the ground up</strong>. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wDUXjLqmcUuWSEXWc1fHNJc24KlfyCh0pvibZYEQM0/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">original spreadsheet</a> was created by <a href="https://shoutplenty.netlify.app/" target="_blank">shoutplenty</a>, a Super Mario Sunshine speedrunner, who created the spreadsheet to track Sunshine ILs. I cloned the original sheet, created the boards for each game, reimplemented some features that did not transfer over, and tested for bugs. Because of this, <strong>I never fully understood the system</strong>: I simple mangled it until it worked for Monkey Ball. After I released the project, I encountered countless formatting & state update issues. Thankfully, I was usually able to fix them, but that was never a guarantee. [Huge shoutout to <a href="https://shoutplenty.netlify.app/" target="_blank">shoutplenty</a>, for all the help he provided along the way.]</li>
            <li><strong>The burden on the user:</strong> The burden of filling the boards <strong>fell on the users.</strong> This is something I could have helped alleviate by submitting on behalf of people, but honestly, I lost interest in this project pretty quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Core features missing:</strong> Things like <strong>totalizers</strong> were impossible to implement, due to how the data was represented on the sheet.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <span>Combine all these together, and you have a product that's just not enticing to anyone, <em>not even myself</em>! I stopped using the sheet just a couple months after release. The main takeaway from this project? <strong>If you want to make a transformative product, you need to do a damn good job!</strong> My hope was that this leaderboard could be the IL community's new home, but it simply was not good enough. With the mistakes made on this project, I aimed to give it another shot with my next project.</span>

          <h2>SMBElite (2023-12-14)</h2>

          <span><a href="https://smbelite.net/" target="_blank">SMBElite</a> is a leaderboard website for the Super Monkey Ball series. Not only can users <strong>view</strong> the IL leaderboards for each chart, they are also able to sign up, and <strong>submit</strong> their own best scores & fast times to any chart they'd like.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>This web application has two components:</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>The Frontend:</strong> This is the part of the website that the user can see. I built this using <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a>, a JavaScript library used to build interactive web interfaces. Going into this project, the only experience I had with React was bulding <strong>this website</strong> (which has since been rewritten in vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript). After completing this project, I feel much more confident in my ability to write flexible, scalable React code. The bulk of this project is React, meaning more of the logic is done on the client rather than the server. Despite this, I have recieved <strong>many</strong> compliments about how fast the website is, something I am very proud of.</li>
            <li><strong>The Backend: </strong> For my backend, I am using <a href="https://supabase.com/" target="_blank">Supabase</a>, an PostgreSQL server on the cloud with built-in authentication, instant APIs, storage, and more. My application connected to Supabase using the <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript Client Library</a>, which allowed me to fetch data, insert data, update data, delete data, and call Postgres functions. This allowed me to avoid building a traditional "server", so I could focus more on the user experience.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <span>The journey of this project starts way back in late 2021, where I began thinking of ideas for an IL leaderboard website. This inspired me to create the <strong>Live IL Sheet</strong>, which I suspected might fail. From the lessons learned from that project, I started working on a <strong>prototype</strong> of the website right at the start of my 2022 Summer Break (May 2022). There was a problem, however. Up to that point, I had never worked with a database, <strong>not even once</strong>.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Thus, I started the summer by learning SQL, and trying to learn the best practices. Once I felt like I had a grasp of SQL, I began building what I would like to call <strong>prototypes of the prototype</strong>. I built a few web pages that would fetch data from a database running on my machine, and render them to the browser in a table. You had to consider, by this point, I also had little to no experience with <strong>asynchronous JavaScript</strong>, so I needed to get familiar with that as well.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>By the end of May, I was ready to begin working on the <strong>actual prototype</strong>. At the time, I believed I was working on the <strong>final product</strong>. In a sense, this is true: I technically kept using the git repository from May 2022, all the way through release. However, I refactored nearly the entire codebase multiple times since the end of last summer, so I consider it to be a prototype now.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <figure class="fr">
            <img class="article-img" src="img/smbelite-prototype.png" alt="Screenshot of early SMBElite prototype from end of Summer 2022">
            <figcaption>Screenshot of early SMBElite prototype from end of Summer 2022</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <span>By the end of my Summer Break, I had a working prototype, which had most of the basic features I wanted implemented:</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>User authentication</li>
            <li>Basic profile customization</li>
            <li>Support for main & custom games</li>
            <li>A split between main and miscellaneous category</li>
            <li>Medal table and totalizers rankings</li>
            <li>Charts for each level, & the ability to submit new high scores / fast times</li>
            <li>Profile pages to view any user's game medals & totals</li>
            <li>Ability for moderators to approve / reject submissions</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <span>This prototype, however, is a far cry from the public product people enjoy today. The <strong>frontend</strong> code had become quite complex, making it a nightmare to work with. As anyone who has experience building software knows, <strong>complexity</strong> leads to <strong>fragility</strong>. The <strong>backend</strong> was arguably even worse. While I did teach myself SQL at the beginning of the summer, I had no idea how to <strong>design</strong> a database, a skill I severely underestimated the importance of. The design of my database was <strong>totally unscalable</strong>. Luckily, during the Fall 2022 semester, I was taking a database class! Because of this, as well as the fact it was my hardest semester, I took a break from working on SMBElite until winter.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <figure class="fr">
            <img class="article-img" src="img/smbelite-db.png" alt="ER diagram of database redesign from Winter 2022 (now outdated)">
            <figcaption>ER diagram of database redesign from Winter 2022 (now outdated)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <span>Using the knowledge gained from the database class, I decided the first change I would make during my winter break was to <strong>totally redesign</strong> the database. Because my application relies on my database, this also meant that I would have to rewrite a large portion of the frontend code. Being on winter break, I was able to knock this out in about a week or two. This database redesign was, <strong>by far</strong>, the most important rework. With a cleaned up database, I was able to come up with far more features than I initially planned!</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Once winter break ended, I worked on the website <strong>part time throughout the spring semester</strong>, and <strong>full time from the beginning of summer, to the beginning of winter</strong>, around 6 months. Truthfully, I wanted to release the website sooner, but scope increased, requiring lots and lots of reworks. Some of the additional major features include:</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Support for categories beyond <strong>Practice Mode</strong> and <strong>Miscellaneous Practice Mode</strong></li>
            <li>Report system</li>
            <li>Notification system</li>
            <li>News system</li>
            <li>
              Splitting the <strong>moderator role</strong> into two roles:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Game Moderators</strong>, who have moderation privileges on a game-by-game basis</li>
                <li><strong>Administrators</strong>, who have moderation privileges on <strong>all</strong> games, as well as additional, more powerful actions</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Displaying each user's high scores and fast times on their profile</li>
            <li>Having a page for each category dedicated to showing the world records</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <span>Many of these features were also reworked many times throughout development! And of course, many of the already existing features were iteratively reworked to make them better and better. As it turns out, building a website that tries to compete with the likes of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/" target="_blank">Speedrun.com</a> and <a href="https://cyberscore.me.uk/" target="_blank">Cyberscore</a> is a <strong>real challenge</strong>! Despite their flaws, both are fairly advanced: building a website as advanced is quite an effort! It gave me a new found respect for both websites.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <figure class="fr">
            <img class="article-img" id="logo" src="img/smbelite-logo.png" alt="SMBElite logo, by Gonquai">
            <figcaption>SMBElite logo, by Gonquai</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <span>By mid-October 2023, most of the website's features were fully implemented. However, the website looked <strong>straight out of the 90s</strong>: I was using the <a href="https://granneman.com/webdev/coding/css/fonts-and-formatting/web-browser-font-defaults" target="_blank">default HTML font</a>, everything was black and white, but at least most things were spaced properly. This is where I need to give a <strong>huge shoutout</strong> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Gonquai" target="_blank">Gonquai</a>, for creating the logo for SMBElite! I could not have even done a fourth as well as he did. Using his logo to start, I based the theming of the website on the pink and purple logo, which is how the website got it's purple theme!</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Mid-November 2023 marked the point where the website was mostly stable for release. You might remember, however, that one of the major issues with the Live IL sheet is that the <strong>burden fell on the user</strong> to submit their own high scores and fast times. Thus, my original plan was to somehow <strong>automate</strong> the transfer of each players PBs across all the games. I quickly realized that this would be impossible, since my website was storing more data per submission than any website or spreadsheet in the past. Thus, I decided to simply collect all the <strong>world records</strong> using automation, and fill in any missing data <strong>manually</strong>. Even with the help of <strong>many</strong> (shoutouts to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeadLineSMB" target="_blank">DeadLine</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@iswimfly4866" target="_blank">iswimfly</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@silverboxxer" target="_blank">Silverboxer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@42guy42" target="_blank">42guy42</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ganonTV" target="_blank">ganon</a>, & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@monkeysmb" target="_blank">monkeysmb</a> for helping me out with this), it still took about a month to transfer all the data over. This process taught me one lesson: <strong>I never want to work a Data Analyst job</strong>!</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>I decided that on the second week of December 2023, <strong>I was ready for public release</strong>. The website was as stable as ever, and had data for at least every WR across all 10 games on the site. And on the <strong>evening of the 13th</strong>, I released <a href="https://www.smbelite.net" target="_blank">SMBElite</a> to the world! I had <strong>never</strong> been as nervous for something as this public release in my entire life.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Thankfully, the launch was relatively smooth, other than the slow email server. I recieved approximetly <strong>30</strong> sign-ups within the first couple of hours, and many more over the coming week. The inital release had a minimal amount of known bugs, <strong>all</strong> of which were fixed within two post-release updates. I recieved a barrage of compliments about the website, which really just made the entire struggle feel worth it. Thank you all for the support! 💙</span>

          </figure>
          <span>As of the <span title="2024-01-17">time of writing this</span>, the website is actively used by the <strong>entire IL community</strong>, and recieves <strong>~550 visits per day on average</strong>. I have a CI/CD pipeline setup on GitHub, so when changes are pushed to <strong>main</strong>, the website will immediately update automatically. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rehtroppp" target="_blank">Rehtrop</a>, a fellow Monkey Ball runner, used the SMBElite API to get his discord bot <strong>MechaMeemee</strong> to post new world records in the <a href="https://discord.gg/qfgPBmtdAA" target="_blank">SMB Elite</a> discord, which I think is super awesome!</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Technically, unlike every other project on this list, <strong>SMBElite is not done!</strong> Althought I am quite happy with the features so far, I have ideas for future additions, which include:</span>
          <br>
          <br>

            <li><strong>Adding more games!</strong> Eventually, I want to have charts for all Monkey Ball games.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanding the capabilities of administrators</strong>. I want to allow administrators to edit information about games, and add new games, through a GUI interface. This will also help accelerate the addition of new games.</li>
            <li><strong>World Record History panel</strong>. It would be cool to have some sort of way to visualize the world record improving on each chart.</li>
