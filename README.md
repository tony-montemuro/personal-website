# [tonysmb.com](https://tonysmb.com): A Personal Website

## A Brief History of This Website

Initially, this website was created in March 2022, as a way to begin learning [React](https://react.dev/), a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. Now that I have been using React for 2 years, I realized that React is a bit overkill for a website like this.

Thus, I ended up rewriting the entire website into vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript in January 2024, as a way to get better at the fundamentals of front-end work.

The actual content of the website remained largely the same through the rewrite, with some new content added to reflect changes in my life, as well as things I have accomplished since early 2022.

I did, however, generally improve the styling of the website, examples include:

- Creating a proper navbar
- Improved aligment of text and image
- Fixing bugs on mobile layout
- Increased the font size of most text
- Adding more whitespace to make giant walls of text more reabable
- Generally more images, to make the website more interesting

I find the current version of the website much easier to read; I hope you agree.
