                    number 4: E40 - 5000 (Tied WR)
                </h2>
                <p className="v-desc-desc">
                    for any monkey ball player who really gets into ils, this is one of those ties that everyone
                    wishes to eventually get. ever since i started playing, i always envied those that could achieve
                    a 5000 on E40, as it just seemed like one of those ils where you need to have mastered the movement
                    in monkey ball. however, up until 2021, i was mostly a super monkey ball 2 player, so i never really
                    gave myself the opportunity to try E40. however, in 2021, i decided to attempt to il every single super monkey 
                    ball 1 level, including E40. however, i decided to save it for last, as i suspected that it would take a while.
                    eventually, i finished iling all the other levels, leaving me with just E40. because this was such a
                    special il, i kept track of two stats: my best score, as well as how much time i had put into attempts.
                    as you can see in the video, i played the level for 8 hours, 44 minutes, and 43 seconds before getting the
                    tie, and my best score i achieved before the 5000 was a 4800, which is a run with two missed bananas.
                    what makes my tie so special on this level is that i managed to skip 4900, which is practically unheard of
                    on this level. also, taking less than ten hours to tie this record is quite impressive, as many others who
                    have tied this record took far longer to achieve 5000. with this information, it definitely makes it sound
                    like my tie was a fluke. i don't like to think of it this way, despite the fact that it's probably true.
                    however, it's important to note that i got my first 4800 just over four hours into attempts, so at least
                    a 4900 was a long time coming.

                <p className="v-desc-desc">
                    of all the achievements i have listed on this page, this one is definitely the odd one out. if you just happened
                    to stumble on this page, or you do not know me all that well, you may just think i am a speedrunner. however, i
                    actually really enjoy fps games; in particular, i really like team-based shooters. games similar to overwatch that
                    i have played a good amount are team fortress 2 and splatoon 1/2. however, of all the fps games i have played, none
                    can compare to the enjoyment i get from overwatch. you may think i sound like a crazy person; don't all overwatch
                    players hate the game, yet still play it? sure, there can be frustrating moments, and it's not fun to get a toxic,
                    throwing teammate. also, it's lame waiting for years for any new content due to blizzard's inability to act like a
                    modern game developer. despite all that, i have yet to play a game that can replicate the feelings i get when i win a
                    really close game of overwatch. i have been playing overwatch ever since launch, but i rarely dabbled into competitive
                    play until around 2019, and ever since then, i have rarely touched quick play. since 2019, i have climbed from mid plat
                    on all roles, to reaching masters on support, as well as diamond on both dps and tank. my main heroes are ana, baptiste,
                    lucio, and zenyatta, but i believe i can play a good amount of the heroes at a fairly decent level at this point. eventually,
                    i would like to reach grandmaster on support, as well as masters rank on dps and tank, but i still have a long way to go.

                    number 2: Punched Seesaws - 33330 (WR)
                </h2>
                <p className="v-desc-desc">
                    of all my records in super monkey ball 2, this is definitely my favorite.
                    i have found quite a few new il strategies in super monkey ball 2, including Totalitarianism score strat,
                    Coin Slots score strat, Planets time strat, Earthquake score strat (which has since evolved from my initial 
                    discovery), etc. i am not the most skilled monkey ball player, so when i find a new strat, sometimes i am not even able
                    to pull it off, and if i can, usually others are able to replicate it, often beating me in the process. what makes
                    Punched Seesaws so special is that i found a new strategy on that level, executed it on March 15th, 2015, and as of 
                    May 3rd, 2022, nobody other than myself has performed this strategy, which has allowed me to hold onto this record for over
                    7 years. the discovery i made on this level is that it is possible to collect the second banana while still managing
                    to finish in the green goal with all the other bananas. previously on this level, people would grab all the bananas but the
                    second one, but i managed to figure out a way to grab it. even if someone eventually does pull off this strategy again, this pb will
                    always be special to me.

                </h2>
                <p className="v-desc-desc">
                    of all the crazy things i have done in video games, nothing has ever come close to the satisfaction and happiness i felt
                    when i got this time on Waluigi Stadium. as you may know, mario kart wii is my all time favorite game. this is because it
                    was the first game i really got into competitively. not many people know this, but even to this day, mario kart wii has an
                    online competitive scene, and back in the day, i used to join 'clans,' and we would do clan wars. this was back in 2011 and
                    2012. however, during this time period, i did not really do too many time trials, as i was more into the online scene. since
                    then, however, i picked up monkey ball as my speed game, and came to enjoy doing ils. well, in mario kart, the equivalent to ils is
                    time trials, and ever since i started playing monkey ball, i have been invested in following the time trial scene for mario kart
                    wii. getting a world record in mario kart wii is one of those things that i always thought would be cool, but i never really believed
                    i could ever do it, as my mario kart wii skills are nothing compared to some of the time trialers. in july of 2020, i began to
                    notice developments for a potential new glitch on waluigi stadium, which caught my attention. finally, after some time, mkwii TASer
                    Ejay B found a <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/Ba3doATUncM"
                        target="_blank"

                        human viable strategy
                    </a> for the ultra shortcut, which would save multiple seconds on the human record if done properly. for one reason or another, i
                    became fascinated with this glitch, and decided to make it a goal of mine to pull it off; getting wr would have been a nice bouns.
                    i even kept track of good attempts: <strong>588 total bypasses</strong> (using the finish line to clip through the track), <strong>310 
                    "good" bypasses</strong> (bypasses that were close to the spot where the glitch is performed), <strong>18 bypasses where I hit the spot
                    and mistimed the hop,</strong> and <strong>2 times where I actually got the glitch but with no lap count.</strong> after grinding attempts
                    of this glitch for two weeks straight, many hours a day, at around 2:30 in the morning, i pulled it off the 1:45.860 while in a discord call
                    with one of my friends. it was really late, so i ended up having the most intense yet quiet pop off of my life after crossing the finish line
                    on lap 3. although it was only world record for around 24 hours, just having my name in the game's permanent history is something i will
                    cherish forever. this was most likely the last time in my life i will ever have the time to grind in a video game super hard, so for that reason, 
                    i don't think any future achievement in a game will ever top this one.
