        <p>The following are my top 5 achievements in gaming:</p>

        <hr>

        <div class="achievement">
          <h2><u>Number #5:</u> Expert 40 - 5,000 (Tied WR)</h2>
          <span>For any Monkey Ball player who really gets into ILs, this is one of those ties that <strong>everyone wishes to eventually get</strong>. Ever since I started playing, I always envied those that could achieve a 5,000 on Expert 40, as it just seemed like an IL where you need to have <strong>mastered the movement in Monkey Ball</strong>. Up until 2021, I was mostly a Super Monkey Ball 2 player, so I never really gave myself the opportunity to try Expert 40.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>In 2021, I decided to attempt to IL <strong>every single level</strong> in Super Monkey Ball 1, including Expert 40. However, I decided to save it for last, as I suspected that it would take a while. Eventually, I finished ILing all the other levels, leaving me with just Expert 40. Because this was such a special IL, I kept track of <strong>2 stats</strong>:
          <br>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>My Best Score</li>
            <li>Time Spent Playing</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <span>As you can see in the video, I played the level for <strong>8 hours, 44 minutes, and 43 seconds</strong> before getting the tie, and my best score I achieved before the 5,000 was a <strong>4,800</strong>, which is a run with two missed bananas. What makes my tie so special on this level is that I managed to <strong>skip 4,900</strong>, which is practically unheard of on this level! Also, taking <strong>less than 10 hours to tie</strong> this record is quite impressive, as many others who have tied this record took far longer to achieve 5,000. With this information, it definitely makes it sound like my tie was a fluke. I don't like to think of it this way, despite the fact that it's probably true. However, it's important to note that I got my first 4,800 just over four hours into attempts, so a 4,900 was <strong>a long time coming</strong>.</span>

        <div class="achievement">
          <h2><u>Number #4:</u> Overwatch 2 - Masters 2 Rank</h2>
          <span>Of all the achievements I have listed on this page, this one is definitely <strong>the odd one out</strong>. If you just happened to stumble on this page, or you do not know me all that well, you may think I am just a speedrunner. However, I actually <strong>really enjoy FPS games</strong>; in particular, I like team-based shooters. Games similar to Overwatch that I have played a good amount include:
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
            <li>Splatoon 1/2/3</li>
            <li>Halo 3</li>
          </ul>
          <br> 
          <span>However, of all the FPS games I have played, <strong>none</strong> can compare to the enjoyment I get from Overwatch. You may think I sound like a crazy person; <strong>don't all overwatch players hate the game, yet still play it</strong>? Sure, there can be frustrating moments, and it's not fun to get a toxic, throwing teammate. Also, it was lame waiting for years for any new content due to Blizzard's inability to act like a modern game developer, only for them to scrap a large portion of the planned content. <strong>Despite all that</strong>, I have yet to play a game that can replicate the feelings I get when I win a really close game of Overwatch.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>I have been playing Overwatch ever since launch, but I rarely dabbled into competitive play until around <strong>2019</strong>, and ever since then, I have rarely touched Quick Play. Since 2019, I have climbed from <strong>mid-Plat</strong> on all roles, to reaching <strong>Masters on Support and Damage</strong>, as well as <strong>Diamond on Tank</strong>. My main heroes are:
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Ana</li>
            <li>Baptiste</li>
            <li>Echo</li>
            <li>Lucio</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <span>But I believe I can play a good amount of the heroes at a fairly decent level. Eventually, I would like to reach <strong>Grandmaster on Support</strong>, and perhaps on <strong>Damage</strong> as well!</span>
